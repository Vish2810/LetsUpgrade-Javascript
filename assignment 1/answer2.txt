In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.
var a=10;let b=20;const PI=3.14;

var: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is “function scoped”.
for example:
var greet = "hey hi";
    
    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }

let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
“let” and “const” are“block scoped”.
for example:
let greeting = "say Hi";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
for example:
const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
